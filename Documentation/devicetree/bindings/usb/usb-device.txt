Generic USB Device Properties

Usually, we only use device tree for hard wired USB device.
The reference binding doc is from:
http://www.firmware.org/1275/bindings/usb/usb-1_0.ps

Required properties:
- compatible: usbVID,PID
- reg: the port number which this device is connecting to, the range
  is 1-31.


Example:

&usb1 {
	status = "okay";

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	hub: genesys@1 {
		compatible = "usb05e3,0608";
		reg = <0x1>;
	};
}
